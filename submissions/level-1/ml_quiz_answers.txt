1. What is supervised learning? Provide an example.

Ans: Supervised learning is a class of problems that have a Training Dataset in the form of input-output pairs which provides
the best output for a sample input. The goal then is to produce a output when a input is given without its corresponding output.
For example: Classification of Dog and Cats problem can be solved with supervised learning as the Training Dataset is givn such that
all samples have known answers whether the image given has a cat or a dog or both.

2. Explain the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning.

Ans: Supervised learning is the method of learning that is tranined using Dataset with input-output pairs while unsipervised learning does not have pairs,
but rather is given a set of objects and is required to find some inherent pattern or structure to produce a output for a new input. Supervised learning has
data that "guides" the model to the right solution while Unsupervised is required to "build its own path" to solve the problem with the set of inputs from an IID.

3. How is reinforcement learning different from supervised learning?

Ans: Reinforcement learning is different from both Unsupervised and Supervised learning as does not have a defined training dataset given to it but rather the
problem is framed in a way of an agent interacting with the surroundings. Reinforcement learning, as the name suggests, is a type where the agent is required to
respond to some situation and is then given reward according to the situation or state and also possibl its response, which reinforces its learning as the feedback
is accounted for in the next action selection.
